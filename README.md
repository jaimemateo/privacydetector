# privacydetector

This project consists on developing an algorithm to preserve people's privacy in video-surveillance systems.

The current work has been developed at Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid as my Master Thesis. I would like now to keep improving it.
The algorithm is built in C++ and uses OpenCV (www.opencv.org) libraries. It also has a DiVA module (developd in VPULab - UAM)
and a Qt interface.
